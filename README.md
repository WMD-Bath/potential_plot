Potential-plot

Takes GULP input file and plots Buckingham potenital, coulombic interaction and total potential on a single plot. 

Current status
- Reads specified gulp file 
- Defults with GULP.gin 
- Plots the Buckingham potential and corresponding coulombic interaction on same plot along with the total potential
  for the specified interaction.
- Saves plots as eps files, named after the atoms involved in that potential


Excecution:

python potentials.py -f file_name


Short-term goals:

To add Lennard potential to plot
